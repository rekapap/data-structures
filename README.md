# Data Structures
Exploring different data structure implmentation and use case with Ruby

## Data Structures

### Stack
Properties
  - it has a 'top' function that return the value the top of the stack
  - it has a 'push' function that adds an element to the top of the stack
  - it has a 'pop' function that removes the top element of the stack
  - it has a 'empty?' function that reurn true if the stack is empty

Problems

1. Read a series of positive numbers from the stdin and every time you read one number print out the MAX and the MIN number in the stack, if the number is -1 pop the top of the stack.

```
problems_lib/min_max.rb
```
